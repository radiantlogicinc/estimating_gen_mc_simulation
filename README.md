## Modeling remediation of defects as an AI-enhanced queueing optimization problem
In industrial contexts, defect remediation is the process by which defects, or undesirable conditions or events that require specific treatement to be resolved, are corrected. This work introduces a new line of research focusing on
the characterization of the defect remediation process and an AI-enhanced black box generalized Monte Carlo optimization problem.

This work represents a research project in three parts:
#### `queueing-MC` Timeline estimations with a black box generalized Monte Carlo method for modeling defect remediation as a queueing optimization problem

#### `queueless-MC` Timeline and state change estimations with a queueless black box generalized Monte Carlo method based on empirical data
#### *Stay tuned!* Optimizing defect remediation planification with generative AI

This project is sponsored by [Radiant Logic](https://www.radiantlogic.com/), an industry leader in the field of identity and access management (IAM), a sub-field of cybersecurity. 

The field of IAM is concerned with the governance and 
management of user accounts and accesses to applications, platforms and other technology resources with the goal of limiting superfluous or unused accesses that serve as openings for cybersecurity attacks in our increasingly connected 
world. In this context, the *defects* of this work are representative of undesirable, risky or anomalous events that must be reviewed and treated by dedicated remediation actors.
